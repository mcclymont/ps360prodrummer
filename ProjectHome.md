# Ps360ProDrummer #

---

## Summary ##
With this program you can connect your Rock Band 3 Pro drum with cymbals or Xbox360 GHWT/GH5 drum to your computer and play it like a real e-drum!

It reads raw usb data from the drum and translates it to midi events.

## Features ##
  * All pads are supported
  * Velocity sensitive (except kick on ProDrum but that's the hardware)
  * MultiNote ( a soft hit triggers a different note than a hard hit )
  * Midi

## Original Program ##
This program is based on the code of PS360Drum which was essentially the same but for the guitar hero world tour  kit.
It was made by **Magnus Ellinge** so all credit about finding out how to interface USB and MIDI goes to him.

## My Work ##
  * Making it work for the Rock Band 3 Pro Drum
  * A hit filter: prevents double hitting
  * Rewritten/reorganized the code
  * New GUI

## Note ##
Works for PS3 RockBand Pro Drum and xbox360 GHWT/GH5 Drum
